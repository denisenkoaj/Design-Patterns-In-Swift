ðŸŒ‰ Bridge
----------

The bridge pattern is used to separate the abstract elements of a class from the implementation details, providing the means to replace the implementation details without modifying the abstraction.

### Example
*/

  func writeCode()

protocol Program {
  var developer: Developer { get set }
  func develop()

### Usage
